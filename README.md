# Classical Image Segmentation

This repository contains a collection of image segmentation algorithms implemented in Python using OpenCV, SimpleITK, and NumPy.

## Segmentation Algorithms

The following segmentation algorithms are included:

1. **Fast Marching Segmentation**: Implemented using SimpleITK.
2. **Threshold Segmentation**: Implemented using OpenCV.
3. **Canny Edge Detection**: Implemented using OpenCV.
4. **Contour Detection**: Implemented using OpenCV.
5. **K-means Segmentation**: Implemented using OpenCV.
6. **Watershed Segmentation**: Implemented using OpenCV.

Each algorithm is implemented in a separate Python file for better organization.

## Usage

To use these segmentation algorithms, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SYED-M-HUSSAIN/Classical-Image-Segmentation-On-Microorganisms.git
```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   
```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the main file:
   
```bash
  python3 main.py
```
## Results Visualization

Here are the segmented images produced by each algorithm on test folder images:
